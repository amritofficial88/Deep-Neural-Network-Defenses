# Deep Neural Network Defenses Strengthening Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks

NOTE: Used Kaggle notebook instead of google colab because of its resource restrictions. 

### About Project:
This project focuses on addressing the susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to trojan attacks. In these attacks, inputs altered with hidden triggers can deceive the network, causing intentional errors in classification. Detecting these altered inputs is a challenging task, especially when the models are in operation. To combat this, our project proposes a two-fold strategy combining Fine-Pruning and STRong Intentional Perturbation (STRIP). This method strengthens the network's defense against these vulnerabilities, enabling the real-time detection of trojan inputs and improving overall network security.
